# Blackjack!
Blackjack is a popular gambling card game in which players attempt to make a hand as close as possible to a sum of 21 without going over.  

Each player is dealt an initial hand of 2 cards. The first player may then choose to "hit" (draw another card into their hand) or "stand" (keep their current hand), and play passes to the next player. A player may hit as many times as they want, but if they go over 21, they "bust" - or automatically lose.

## Scoring
In determining hand totals, cards get the following values:  
1. All face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10.  
2. Aces can count as either 1 or 11, whatever is the best case for user to not get BUSTed.  
3. All other cards have the value shown on the card (ie 2 will be worth 2, 3 will be worth 3, and so on).

## Outcomes  
Each player (excluding the dealer) has one of the three possible outcomes:  
- **Lose**: any player who busts or has a hand value less than the dealer, loses.  
- **Win**: any player who does not bust and has a hand value greater than the dealer, wins.  
- **Push**: any player who does not bust and has a hand value matching the dealer, pushes (ties).
