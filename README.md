# Blackjack!
Blackjack is a popular gambling card game in which players attempt to make a hand as close as possible to a sum of 21 without going over.  

Each player is dealt an initial hand of 2 cards. The first player may then choose to "hit" (draw another card into their hand) or "stand" (keep their current hand), and play passes to the next player. A player may hit as many times as they want, but if they go over 21, they "bust" - or automatically lose.
